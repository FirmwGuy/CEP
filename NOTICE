Third-party components used for test builds only:
- µnit Testing Framework (munit) — Copyright (c) 2013–2017 Evan Nemerson — MIT License.
  Vendored in `src/third_party/munit/munit.c` and `src/third_party/munit/munit.h`.
  See the license header in those files for the full MIT license text.

Third-party components used by the core library:
- BLAKE3 reference implementation — Copyright (c) 2019–2024
  Samuel Neves, Jack O'Connor, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luke Malinowski, and
  the BLAKE3 contributors — dual-licensed Apache 2.0 or CC0. CEP uses BLAKE3 for
  hashing (`cep_hash_bytes`, flat serializer Merkle roots, etc.). The vendored C/assembly
  backend lives in `src/third_party/blake3/`; see `LICENSE_A2` and `LICENSE_CC0`
  in that directory for the full terms.

- zlib (Mark Adler et al.) — zlib License. CEP links against the full zlib library for
  CRC32 and optional deflate compression. A verbatim snapshot lives under
  `src/third_party/zlib/` and is built when the `-Dzlib_provider=bundled` option is used
  or no system zlib is available.

- libsodium (Frank Denis et al.) — ISC License. A verbatim copy of the
  upstream libsodium tree lives in `src/third_party/libsodium/` to provide the
  ChaCha20-Poly1305/XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD helpers plus their dependencies.
  Builds prefer linking against a system libsodium via `-Dlibsodium_provider=system`;
  the bundled subset is compiled only when no system library is available or the user
  explicitly selects `-Dlibsodium_provider=bundled`.

Notes:
- Test sources other than `munit.*` are dedicated to the public domain (CC0 1.0).
- The installed library and headers do not contain munit; it is only compiled into test binaries.
