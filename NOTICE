Third-party components used for test builds only:
- µnit Testing Framework (munit) — Copyright (c) 2013–2017 Evan Nemerson — MIT License.
  Vendored in `src/third_party/munit/munit.c` and `src/third_party/munit/munit.h`.

- BLAKE3 reference implementation — Copyright (c) 2019–2024
  Samuel Neves, Jack O'Connor, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luke Malinowski, and
  the BLAKE3 contributors — dual-licensed Apache 2.0 or CC0. Vendored C/assembly
  backend lives in `src/third_party/blake3/`; see `LICENSE_A2` and `LICENSE_CC0`

Third-party components used by the core library:
- zlib CRC32 (Mark Adler et al.) — zlib License. The fallback CRC32 source lives in
  `src/third_party/zlib/` (files `crc32.c`, `zlib.h`, `zconf.h`, `zutil.h`) and is used
  only when a system zlib is unavailable or the build is configured with
  `-Dzlib_provider=bundled`.

Notes:
- Test sources other than `munit.*` are dedicated to the public domain (CC0 1.0).
- The installed library and headers do not contain munit; it is only compiled into test binaries.
