# Cascade Evolutionary Processing (CEP)

A living architecture for deterministic work, adaptive exploration, and shared meaning.

## 1) What CEP is

CEP is a way to build systems that behave like communities, not just machines. At the base, it keeps simple truths steady; in the middle, it lets different tactics coexist and learn; at the top, it turns experience into rules and stories people can trust.

Think of it like this:
- Cells and enzymes are the nuts and bolts: small facts and tiny workers that transform them.
- Bonds, contexts, and facets are the connective tissue: how facts relate and stay coherent.
- Organisms and species are the playbooks: multiple flows try tactics, and the right tactic wins in the right place.
- Perspectives and interpretations make the system aware; conventions and summaries stabilize what it learns.
- Councils, laws, reforms, and provinces are governance as code.
- Stories, legends, and myths are how knowledge sticks without losing traceability.

Everyday analogy: a well-run kitchen line. Orders (cells) arrive, cooks (enzymes) work in rhythm (heartbeat), and plates only hit the pass on the next beat. No plate cuts the line; everything remains explainable and calm.

## 2) Technical Details

### 2.1 Core Rhythm: Heartbeats (Capture -> Compute -> Commit)

CEP advances in beats. Each beat is a strict three-phase contract:
1) Capture - ingest new Cells; freeze the input set for beat N.
2) Compute - Enzymes and Flows read <= N and stage outputs.
3) Commit - publish staged outputs atomically as beat N+1.

No one can cut the line, and replay is exact when the same inputs and recorded choices are honored.

Deterministic with exploration: any non-deterministic choice (policy pick, RNG draw, ML selection) must emit a Decision Cell. On replay, the recorded decision is consumed instead of re-sampling, so results match exactly.

### 2.2 Truth Substrate: Cells, Beings, Contexts, Facets

Cells (immutable facts)
- Append-only: corrections are new Cells, not edits.
- Provenance-by-construction: derived Cells link their parents (sources), code identity, and (when relevant) the Decision Cell.
- Optional content address: store a payload hash alongside path identity for integrity/dedup.
- Kernel scaffolding: DT naming, "as of beat" history, links with backlinks, multiple child stores, chunked serialization.

Beings and Bonds (durable identity and relations)
- Beings are long-lived identities; Bonds are typed relations (often pairs).
- Layer 1 manages identity and relationship ledgers via a replay-friendly API and storage layout.

Contexts (N-ary) and Facets (closure)
- A Context ties several Beings with role-typed positions (for example, user <-> widget <-> document).
- Facets are the smaller truths implied by a Context. Layer 1 guarantees closure by materializing required Facets or recording a deterministic debt to finish them.
- Adjacency mirrors are transient caches that speed neighborhood queries; the durable ledger under `/data/coh/*` remains authoritative.

### 2.3 Flow Layer: A Small, Deterministic VM

Flows compile to deterministic state machines with five constructs:
- Guard - pure preconditions.
- Transform - emit Cells.
- Wait - suspend on a pattern/impulse.
- Decide - branch via a Policy; always emit a Decision Cell.
- Clamp - budgets, timeouts, and parallelism limits.

Variants, Niches, and Guardians
- Keep multiple variants (species) of a flow.
- Route by niches (contexts -> variants) so each context sees the tactic that fits.
- Explore via bandits or policies, but record every draw as a Decision Cell.
- Enforce safety gates (Guardians) as schematized invariants; violations emit structured facts for explainability.

### 2.4 Cognition: Awareness That Accumulates

- Perspectives - declarative, materialized views with incremental maintenance per beat.
- Interpretations - computed tags/scores with provenance.
- Conventions - promoted patterns with stability thresholds (support, duration, exceptions).
- Summaries - tiered rollups (minute -> hour -> day) with links to source ranges.

All of the above live as derived Cells and indexes. Layer 1's closure and adjacency keep structure crisp and queries fast.

### 2.5 Society: Governance as Code

- Laws - signed, versioned bundles (schemas, policies, organisms).
- Reforms - reversible migrations with pre/post checks and compensations.
- Councils - workflows to propose, review, enact, monitor, and rollback.
- Provinces - namespaced sandboxes that scope deployments and experiments; cross-province relations require explicit "imported" facets.

### 2.6 Culture: Evidence-Linked Narratives

Stories, Legends, and Myths are typed artifacts that point back into the fact graph (Perspectives, Laws, Decisions). They turn tacit practice into shareable memory, without losing traceability.

### 2.7 Observability, Privacy, and Replay

- End-to-end provenance from any fact to sources, guards, code ids, and council approvals.
- Time-travel replay: re-run any beat range with side effects disabled; outputs must match when Decision Cells are honored.
- Privacy: payload-level crypto with per-subject keys; erasure by dropping keys while preserving structural stubs; redaction cells for reversible masking.

The Kernel's proxies, links, and serialization provide the hooks; crypto lives above it.

### 2.8 Scale and Federation

Scale horizontally by partitions (shards) with local heartbeats. Exchange deltas via serialization; model cross-shard imports as Cells. Avoid global barriers; use occasional sync pulses to bring summaries into alignment when needed.

### 2.9 Minimal Viable CEP (Adopt Gradually)

1) Layer 0 - Kernel + Heartbeat - deterministic substrate.
2) Layer 1 - Coherence - Beings, Bonds, Contexts with Facet closure.
3) Layer 2 - Flow VM + Decision Cells - explicit branches with recorded choices.
4) Layer 3 - Perspectives - a few materialized views for essential awareness.
5) Layer 4 - Governance - basic Laws/Reforms/Councils for safe change.

### 2.10 Worked Example: The Save Action

Event (beat 10, Capture)
```
Event#click1 { widget=saveBtn, user=alice }
```

Coherence (Compute)
- Layer 1 emits a Context tying (user, widget, doc) and the implied Facets (closure).

Flow
- RunActionOnClick checks guards, executes a Decide (autosave every 30s vs 60s), records the choice as a Decision Cell, then emits `Exec#saveDoc`.
- Guardians enforce "no write without auth" and "no excessive thrash".

Commit (beat 11)
- Outputs become visible; Perspectives update incrementally.

Governance and Culture
- A stable shortcut pattern becomes a Law. A Story links the rollout to evidence so people can learn the lesson quickly.

## 3) Q&A

Is CEP a programming language?
- No. It is the stage where many languages can perform.

Isn't determinism vs exploration a contradiction?
- We record every choice as a Decision Cell. That is how replays match exactly.

Why immutability and provenance-by-construction?
- Append-only facts and linked derivations make audits honest and debugging direct.

How does CEP scale and federate?
- Use local heartbeats and partitions. Exchange deltas as Cells; align summaries with occasional sync pulses. Councils govern locally; provinces keep experiments safe.

How do I debug?
- Follow provenance: sources, guards, policy decisions, enzyme/flow identities, and council approvals. Replay beats with side-effects disabled to confirm fixes.

What about privacy and deletion?
- Encrypt payloads with per-subject keys; erase by dropping keys but keep structural stubs. Redaction cells enable reversible masking when policy allows.

Will variants explode?
- Clamp budgets and time; guardians enforce invariants; weak variants get pruned. Niches route contexts to the right tactic.

Do I need all layers on day one?
- No. Start with Kernel + Heartbeat; bring in higher-layer packs (coherence, flows, governance) as they mature and you need them.

Why stories and myths in a system design?
- Shared narratives are how people remember and align. CEP links stories back to evidence so meaning never drifts from truth.
