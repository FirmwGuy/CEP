# L0 Kernel: Algorithms Report

Below is a focused, implementation‑grounded report of the **main, cross‑cutting algorithms** in CEP—what they are for, how they work, and where they live in the code. I center on the parts that operate across several layers (naming → cells/stores → history & traversal → dispatch → streaming), and include concrete pointers to the relevant entry points.

---

## Legend: the identifiers and paths the algorithms are built on

* **Domain–Tag (DT) naming & cepID encoding.** CEP names every cell with a compact, 58‑bit per‑field identifier (`cepDT`), with four encodings (word, acronym, reference, numeric). Helpers encode/decode and match wildcards; these are pervasive in the algorithms below (e.g., lookups, path matching, enzyme resolution) .
* **Name pool (interning).** When you need stable “reference” IDs from text, the namepool maintains interned strings backing `CEP_NAMING_REFERENCE` so DTs remain small and stable: `cep_namepool_intern`, `lookup`, `release` .
* **Paths.** A `cepPath` is a DT sequence from root to a cell; many algorithms accept/emit paths to keep work deterministic and decoupled from in‑memory pointers (e.g., traversal, enzymes, serialization) .

---

## 1) Append‑only timelines & structural history

**Why it exists.** CEP chooses an append‑only model so readers can reconstruct *any* past shape or payload without making full clones on every edit. That enables snapshot traversal, deterministic reindexing, and streaming diffs.

**What it does.**

* **Payload histories.** Every data update copies the current `cepDataNode` metadata into the `past` chain before writing the new value (`cep_data_history_push`, `cep_cell_update`). For `DATA` payloads, the algorithm conditionally deep‑copies or “swap‑takes” the buffer (depending on the `swap` flag), then recomputes a stable content hash. That builds a per‑cell timeline in O(1) per mutation with optional O(n) copy when deep‑copying the old bytes .
* **Store layout snapshots (only when order changes).** When a collection is reindexed (e.g., “turn into dictionary” or “sort by custom compare”), the store takes a *layout snapshot* (`cep_store_history_push`) that records the prior sibling order and per‑entry pointers so later historical traversals can reconstruct that exact order without keeping a full copy of the child tree. This is taken *only* when reordering; normal append keeps order by timestamp .

**Where it lives.**
`cep_data_history_push`, `cep_cell_update`, `cep_store_history_*`, and the timestamp helpers are in the cell implementation; `cepCell`/`cepStore` headers define the shapes and invariants  .

---

## 2) Link “shadow” bookkeeping (bidirectional backlinks)

**Why it exists.** Links are first‑class cells. To keep link targets consistent (e.g., mark links as “target is dead”, rebind on clones, cleanly break on teardown), the runtime maintains backlink metadata (“shadows”). This prevents cycles and keeps link‑heavy graphs correct.

**What it does.**

* **Adaptive representation.** The target holds either a single backlink pointer or a small dynamically‑resized array structure (`cepShadow`) if multiple links point to it. The attach/detach algorithm transparently upgrades/downgrades between single → multiple (doubling capacity), and performs O(1) removals by swapping with the last entry .
* **Consistency operations.**

  * `cep_link_set` detaches from the old target (if any), normalizes chains (always ends on a non‑link cell), and attaches to the new target while switching the shadow container as needed.
  * `cep_cell_shadow_mark_target_dead` mirrors the target’s soft‑delete bit into all linkers so readers won’t follow stale references.
  * `cep_shadow_break_all` safely unhooks all incoming links before hard finalization; `cep_shadow_rebind_links` reattaches backlinks when a cell is moved/cloned .

**Where it lives.**
Shadow attach/detach/mark logic and `cep_link_set/pull` are implemented in the cell core file; types are in the headers  .

---

## 3) Insertion, deduplication, auto‑id, and reindexing

**Why it exists.** CEP supports multiple child storage engines (list/array/packed queue/red‑black tree/hash table/octree) and several indexing policies (by insertion, by name, by custom function, by hash). The algorithms centralize policy enforcement, deduplication, and auto‑id assignment.

**What it does.**

* **Add/append with structural dedup.** `cep_store_add_child`/`cep_store_append_child` consult indexing mode and delegate to the backend (list/array/etc.). Before insertion, they detect structurally identical records (`cep_cell_structural_equal`) and return the existing one, or replace when policy allows. This keeps idempotency across layers .
* **Auto‑ID assignment.** When the child tag is `CEP_AUTOID`, the parent assigns a monotonically increasing numeric tag; if callers provide an explicit numeric tag, the parent’s cursor is advanced accordingly so IDs remain unique and monotone via `store_check_auto_id` .
* **Reindexing with layout snapshots.**

  * `store_to_dictionary`: rebuilds a collection into a dictionary keyed by `cepDT` (name), taking a single “before” snapshot and sorting children with a composite name+recency comparator.
  * `store_sort`: reorders by a custom comparator (or changes from hash→compare) while snapshotting the prior order. Both update the store timestamp as the append‑only record of the mutation .

**Where it lives.**
Child storage creation/ops (`cep_store_new`, add/append/find/sort) and structural equality are in the cell core file; the API surface is in the header  .

---

## 4) Snapshot‑aware traversal (shallow & deep)

**Why it exists.** Read‑side algorithms need to “see the world as of heartbeat T”. CEP provides snapshot filters over both *topology* and *payloads* without changing the live graph.

**What it does.**

* **Shallow traversal at time T.** `cep_cell_traverse_past` wraps the normal `store_traverse` and emits only entries alive at T. Internally it builds a small state machine (`cepTraversePastCtx`): buffer 1 pending entry, flush it when the next visible entry arrives (so callers get `prev/next/position` filled consistently) .
* **Deep traversal at time T.** `cep_cell_deep_traverse_past` generalizes the above to depth‑first traversal. It maintains a per‑depth frame array (`cepTraversePastFrame`), flushing pending nodes before descending and after list ends. This mirrors the live traversal API so tools written for live graphs can also replay the past with the same callbacks .
* **Finders at time T.** Point lookups (`*_find_by_name_past`, `*_find_by_position_past`) and iterators (`*_find_next_by_name_past`, `*_find_next_by_path_past`) apply the same alive‑at‑T checks while reusing the store backends. The path enumerator retains per‑depth iterator state on stack or heap, scaling with path length in O(depth) space and O(matches) time .

**Where it lives.**
Traversal wrappers, snapshot filters, and the past‑aware search helpers are in the cell core file; the traversal surface is in the header  .

---

## 5) Cloning (with handle/stream semantics)

**Why it exists.** Tools often need a structural copy without disturbing shared external resources. CEP clones VALUE/DATA payloads, but handles/streams are *not* duplicated—they become links to the original.

**What it does.**
`cep_cell_clone_into` performs two strategies:

* **Value/Data:** deep‑copy the payload and optionally the child store (for deep clones).
* **Handle/Stream:** create a **link** to the source cell (not a second handle), keeping the foreign resource unified. The clone clears shadow bits and rewires children/stores/locks safely. `cep_cell_clone` (shallow) and `cep_cell_clone_deep` (deep) compose this routine; helpers exist to clone store structure and children (`cep_store_clone_structure`, `cep_cell_clone_children`) .

**Where it lives.**
Cloning routines and the special cases for handles/streams are in the core implementation; types are in the header  .

---

## 6) Serialization & streaming (chunked wire format)

**Why it exists.** CEP streams cells across processes/storage in a way that (a) is self‑describing and resynchronizable, (b) preserves path identity, (c) handles large payloads incrementally, and (d) restores proxies via library callbacks.

**What it does.**

* **Writer (emitter).** `cep_serialization_emit_cell` writes:

  1. a **control header** chunk with magic/version/options (`cep_serialization_header_write`),
  2. a **manifest** with the DT path + flags describing the cell’s type and whether it has data/proxy,
  3. a **data descriptor** (VALUE/DATA) either inline or as separate **blob** chunks if the payload exceeds a blob limit, and
  4. a **control** chunk marking end of transaction. The emitter enforces monotonically increasing `(transaction, sequence)` in chunk ids so readers can sanity‑check streams and resume at boundaries .
* **Reader (ingest/commit state machine).**

  * `cep_serialization_reader_ingest` validates each chunk, reorders nothing, and **stages** manifests, data headers, blobs, and library snapshots in a per‑transaction structure. For chunked data it allocates a buffer of the final size and copies each slice at the declared offset; hashes are verified against `(dt,size,payload)`.
  * When a **control** chunk arrives, `commit` applies all staged changes: it materializes nodes at the path (creating intermediate dictionaries when necessary), writes payloads, and calls proxy restore hooks for library‑backed cells. Only successful commits mutate the tree; otherwise the reader is failed/reset. The apply code respects existing types and replaces payloads with correct destructors .

**Where it lives.**
All emitter/reader algorithms, chunk format, and integrity checks (hashes, path, sequencing) are in the serialization module; cell/path helpers are used extensively from the cell layer .

## 7) Enzyme dispatch: matching, binding, partial order, and agenda build

**Why it exists.** CEP’s “enzymes” are deterministic units of work. An **impulse** (signal path + target path) must resolve to a **stable, dependency‑honoring** execution order that respects (a) which enzymes are bound at/above the target, (b) which ones match the signal (exact/prefix), and (c) explicit before/after constraints.

**What it does.**

1. **Registry & activation.** Enzymes register with a name, match policy, flags, and before/after lists. Registrations made during a live beat are held in a *pending* table and later activated en bloc so the agenda is **frozen** during resolution (`cep_enzyme_registry_activate_pending`)  .
2. **Indexing.** The registry builds two indexes: by enzyme **name** and by the **head DT** of the query path. Buckets are sorted and binary‑searched to cut down candidate sets during matching (`cep_enzyme_registry_rebuild_indexes`) .
3. **Collect effective bindings along the target path.** The resolver walks from target up to root, merging **propagated** bindings and honoring **tombstones** (unbinds) to compute the active enzyme name set at the focal node (the algorithm deduplicates per‑name and tracks masked entries) (`cep_enzyme_collect_bindings`)  .
4. **Intersect with signal matches & score specificity.**

   * For each bound name, look up registry bucket, filter entries by the **signal path** with EXAC T or PREFIX policy, and compute a **specificity** score as the number of concrete DT components in both target and signal patterns.
   * If there’s *no* target path (pure signal dispatch), pull candidates by the signal head bucket instead.
   * Merge candidates by **preference**: first by whether they match both target and signal, then by total specificity, then by name, then by registration order (`cep_enzyme_match_prefer`, `cep_enzyme_matches_signal`) .
5. **Dependency‑aware agenda.** Build a graph from the surviving matches using `before` and `after` lists. The algorithm computes indegrees and performs a **stable topological sort**; the ready set is a **priority heap** ordered by the same match preference to ensure a *deterministic* tie‑break among otherwise independent tasks. The resulting order is returned in a caller‑provided array (`cep_enzyme_resolve`) .

**Where it lives.**
All dispatch logic—the registry, matching, binding walk, and topo sort—live in `cep_enzyme.c`; the descriptor/impulse API and binding struct are in the headers and cell layer respectively   .

---

## 8) Heartbeat impulse queue (capture & reuse)

**Why it exists.** To decouple emission from resolution, impulses are recorded into a compact queue that clones paths just once and can be reset/swapped efficiently between beats.

**What it does.**
A capacity‑doubling array of `cepHeartbeatImpulseRecord` stores pointers to cloned paths for signal and target. Append reserves capacity, clones paths, and bumps count; reset/destroy zero the slots and free paths. The queue supports constant‑time swaps to hand off between producers/consumers (`cep_heartbeat_impulse_queue_append/reset/swap/destroy`) .

---

## 9) Locking and hierarchical guards

**Why it exists.** To preserve invariants during concurrent or multi‑phase edits, CEP offers fine‑grained locks on **data** and **store** hierarchies. Mutators check these before changing structure or payload.

**What it does.**
`cep_store_lock`/`cep_data_lock` plant a lock token on the target cell’s store/data; higher‑level checks walk up parent pointers to detect **any** lock in the ancestor chain (`cep_cell_store_locked_hierarchy`, `cep_cell_data_locked_hierarchy`). All mutating paths—including updates, adds, deletes, and reindexing—early‑exit when the hierarchy is locked, preventing partial states and races across layers  .

---

## 10) Path construction and “as‑of‑path” resolution

**Why it exists.** Serialization, enzymes, and navigation need a consistent, canonical identity that does not rely on memory addresses.

**What it does.**
`cep_cell_path` walks parents to the root into a resizable buffer (amortized O(depth)), then normalizes it into the caller‑provided `cepPath`. It can optionally append the *data dt* and *store dt* of the leaf, so consumers know exactly what payload and child type were visible. Path‑based finders (`cep_cell_find_by_path_past`) replay each segment—respecting per‑segment snapshot timestamps—to locate the target at time T .

---

## 11) Ordering policy for “recent first, alive first”

**Why it exists.** When stable tie‑breakers are needed (e.g., equal names), CEP prefers **alive** entries over dead ones and more **recent** timestamps over older ones.

**What it does.**
`cep_cell_order_compare` ranks by (1) alive vs dead, (2) latest timestamp aggregated from the cell/data/store, (3) address as a final tie‑breaker. This comparator is used in several reindexing and traversal internal paths to make results deterministic without hidden state .

---

# Quick index of the most impactful entry points (with purpose)

* **History & snapshots:** `cep_cell_update`, `cep_data_history_push`, `cep_store_history_push/clear` 
* **Links & shadows:** `cep_link_set/pull`, `cep_cell_shadow_mark_target_dead`, `cep_shadow_*` helpers 
* **Insertion & reindex:** `cep_store_add_child`, `cep_store_append_child`, `store_to_dictionary`, `store_sort` 
* **Traversal API (live/past):** `cep_cell_traverse`, `cep_cell_deep_traverse`, `cep_cell_traverse_past`, `cep_cell_deep_traverse_past` 
* **Cloning:** `cep_cell_clone`, `cep_cell_clone_deep` (plus `cep_store_clone_structure`) 
* **Serialization:** `cep_serialization_emit_cell`, `cep_serialization_reader_ingest`, `cep_serialization_reader_commit` 
* **Enzyme dispatch:** `cep_enzyme_resolve` and registry lifecycle (register/activate/unregister)  
* **Heartbeat impulses:** `cep_heartbeat_impulse_queue_append/reset/swap/destroy` 
* **Locking:** `cep_store_lock/unlock`, `cep_data_lock/unlock`, `cep_cell_*_locked_hierarchy`  
* **Namepool:** `cep_namepool_intern/lookup/release` for CEP_NAMING_REFERENCE 

---

## Complexity & practical notes (per algorithm)

* **History:** O(1) per update for metadata; copying cost proportional to payload when deep‑copying. Store reindexing sorts in O(n log n) for list/array, O(n) bucket rebuilds for hash/trees as implemented by backends invoked from `store_sort`/`store_to_dictionary` .
* **Shadows:** O(1) attach; O(1) detach via swap‑with‑last; capacity grows geometrically. Move/clone preserves backlinks in O(k) where k is link count to the node .
* **Traversal past:** O(visible nodes) with constant extra per node; deep traversal uses O(depth) state; no recursion (explicit stack/frames) for robustness .
* **Serialization:** Writer is linear in path length + payload size; reader is linear in the sum of chunk sizes with strict sequencing and hash checks. Large blobs are streamed in slices of configurable size (default if zero) .
* **Enzyme resolution:**

  * Matching: O(log n) to find buckets + O(candidates) to filter.
  * Agenda: O(m + e) for the topo sort where m is matched enzymes and e the realized dependency edges; heap operations add O(log m) per ready push/pop; overall deterministic and stable .

---

## Interactions to keep in mind

* **Append‑only + traversal** give you “time travel” for both data and shape without copying trees; **reindex snapshots** make order reconstructions deterministic across beats (history of siblings is preserved only when order changes) .
* **Serialization** uses **paths**, not addresses—paired with append‑only rules and per‑segment timestamps, you can faithfully reconstruct historical or live state on another process, including **proxy** payloads via library snapshots/restores .
* **Enzyme bindings** are stored on data/store timelines (append‑only), and the dispatcher intentionally consults the **effective** set along the path (with propagation and tombstones) before matching against signal indexes, then performs a topology‑respecting, preference‑sorted topological order build  .
